== DESCRIPTION:

Juicer is a command line tool that helps you ship frontend code for production.

High level overview; Juicer can

* figure out which files depend on each other and merge them together, reducing
  the number of http requests per page view, thus improving performance
* use YUI Compressor to compress code, thus improving performance
* verify that your JavaScript is safe to minify/compress by running JsLint on it
* cycle asset hosts in CSS files
* add "cache busters" to URLs in CSS files
* recalculate relative URLs in CSS files, as well as convert them to absolute
  (or convert absolute URLs to relative URLs)

== FEATURES:

=== Merging and minifying

Juicer can read @import statements in CSS files and use them to combine all your
stylesheets into a single file. This file may be minified using the YUI
Compressor. Eventually it will support other minifying tools too.

Juicer can treat your JavaScript files much the same way too, parsing a comment
switch @depend, as this example shows:

  /**
   * My script file
   *
   * @depend jquery-1.2.0.js
   */
  var myNS = {
      myObject = {}
  };

Running <tt>juicer merge</tt> on this file will result in a minified file
<tt>filename.min.js</tt> containing the file jquery-1.2.0.js (located in the
same directory) and the code above.

You can use @import (CSS files) and @depend (JavaScript) recursively, effectively
creating a dependency chain for Juicer to climb and merge.

=== Paths

When merging CSS files, you may want to merge CSS files in different directories.
You may also want the resulting CSS file to end up in another directory as well.
Juicer automatically recalculates referenced URLs to reflect this change.

Absolute URLs are not changed by default, but if you provide juicer merge
with <code>--document-root [DIR]</code> and <code>--relative-urls</code> then
absolute URLs are converted to URLs relative to output directory. You can also
use <code>--absolute-urls</code> to convert all URLs to absolute ones.

=== Cache busters

Juicer supports so-called cache busters. A cache buster is a pattern in a path
whose only purpose is to "trick" browsers to redownload a file when it has
changed in cases where a far future expires header is used.

There are two types of cache busters; soft ones add a parameter to the URL, like
so: http://assets/images/1.png?cb1234567890, ie the letters "cb" (as in cache
buster) and then the timestamp of the files mtime.

Unfortunately, the popular web proxy Squid shipped for some time with a default
configuration which would not treat a URL as a "new" URL if the only thing changed
was the GET parameters. For this reason Juicer provides hard cache busters.

Hard cache busters result in URLs such as: http://assets/images/1-cb1234567890.png,
ie URLs that require either renaming of files, or (more conveniently) a web
server configuration that will forward URLs to the right files anyway.

=== Embedding images in stylesheets

Juicer supports embedding images into stylesheets using data uri's.

In order to be as unobtrusive as possible, you must indicate for each image that it 
should be embedded in the stylesheet by using the embed suffix.

Example:
    
    h1 { background: url(/somepath/someimage.png?embed=true); }

And when building the stylesheets, you must specify which type of embedding you want,
currently only 'none' and 'data_uri' are supported.

    $ juicer merge my-stylesheet.css -o my-stylesheet.merged.css -e data_uri
    
The results will look something like this:

    h1 { background: url(data:image/png;base64,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); }

Embedding images in stylesheets should be used very carefully, as they will bloat your css files considerably, and you will loose some of the fine grained control over caching.

Support for IE7, IE6 and IE5 is planned for near future, once the data_uri scheme has stabilized.

== PLANNED FEATURES:

Juicer 0.2.0 is the first usable release. Work will continue from here. Improving
documentation and APIs is one concern, but there are also new features planned:

* Support more minifiers, JsMin (Ruby port), Packer and possibly others
* Add support for CssTidy to compress CSS files
* juicer build, a command that can build several files in one swoop using a
  configuration file
* juicer doc, a command that produces documentation using YUI Doc or JsDoc

If you have any ideas, feature requests, want to contribute or whatever, fork
the project on github, or get in touch through christian (at) cjohansen.no.

== SYNOPSIS:

  juicer merge myfile.css
  -> Produces myfile.min.css which may contain several CSS files, minified

  juicer merge myfile.js
  -> Produces myfile.min.js, minified and combined

  juicer help

== REQUIREMENTS:

In order to use YUI Compressor and JsMin (requires Rhino) you need Java
installed and the java executable available on your path.

== INSTALL:

  $ gem install juicer
  $ juicer install yui_compressor
  $ juicer install jslint

You need Java installed and available on your PATH. During gem installation,
Juicer will download and install YUI Compressor, JsLint and Rhino for you.

== For developers

Before running tests you should run
  rake test:setup

which brings in third party libraries (ie, requires a working network connection)
